This is a simple plugin to change the link of your logo in the top left-hand corner to any URL you would like and works with most themes.

== Description ==
This plugin will add an option in Settings called Set Logo Link which will allow you change the link to another url.  After you activate this plugin, when someone clicks on your site logo instead of going to the home page of your WordPress site, it will go to whatever url you have entered here.

This plugin uses the get_custom_logo filter instead of JavaScript to change the logo link so the actual HTML of your site will change instead of changing on each page load via JavaScript.


== Installation ==
Upload the easylogochange folder to wp-content/plugins

Activate the plugin and set the url you would like to use in Settings->Set Logo Link.
